These docs are still in progress. Below are preliminary benchmarks comparing `LegendList` to `FlatList` and `FlashList`. These metrics are placeholders and will be updated with real data as testing progresses.

## Performance Benchmarks

| Metric                  | LegendList | FlatList | FlashList | Notes                              |
|-------------------------|------------|----------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| **Initial Render Time** | XXXms      | XXXms    | XXXms     | 1000 items, simple text render     |
| **Scroll FPS (60fps)**  | XXfps      | XXfps    | XXfps     | 5000 items, mixed content          |
| **Memory Usage**        | XXMB       | XXMB     | XXMB      | 10,000 items, images + text        |
| **Item Recycling**      | Yes        | No       | Yes       | Efficiency with dynamic content   |
| **Cold Start Time**     | XXXms      | XXXms    | XXXms     | App launch with 2000 items         |
| **Re-render Time**      | XXms       | XXms     | XXms      | Update 10% of 5000 items           |
| **CPU Usage**           | XX%        | XX%      | XX%       | Continuous scroll, 3000 items      |

### Notes
- **Initial Render Time**: Time to render the list on screen from a blank state.
- **Scroll FPS**: Frames per second during smooth scrolling; higher is better (target 60fps).
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption during list operation.
- **Item Recycling**: Whether the list reuses item views for performance.
- **Cold Start Time**: Time from app launch to fully rendered list.
- **Re-render Time**: Time to update the list after data changes.
- **CPU Usage**: Average CPU load during active scrolling.

These benchmarks are based on simulated conditions (e.g., iOS 16, mid-tier device). Actual performance may vary depending on hardware, React Native version, and list content complexity. Stay tuned for finalized data!
