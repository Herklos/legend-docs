Legend List is a high performance virtualized ScrollView library for React Native. Compared to FlatList and FlashList it's faster, simpler, and has useful features they don't support.

- ✨ Extremely fast
- ✨ Dynamic item sizes
- ✨ Optional recycling
- ✨ Bidirectional infinite lists
- ✨ Chat list without inverting
- ✨ Maintain content view position
- ✨ Recycling hooks

## Beta

Legend List is in beta. It seems to be feature complete and reliable, but we are just taking some time to take feedback from the community and make sure it's stable for a 1.0 release.

This documentation is still early.

## Install

import Install from "shared/src/Components/Install/Install.astro";

<Install name="@legendapp/list" />
